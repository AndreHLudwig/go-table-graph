# go-table-graph

## Overview

````go-table-graph```` is a web application written in Go that allows you to visualize database table relationships as an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. It connects to local PostgreSQL databases, extracts table structures, and renders the ER diagram using the vis-network JavaScript library for interactive visualization.

## Requirements

- **Go**: Ensure that you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [go.dev](https://go.dev/dl/).

- **PostgreSQL Database**: You need access to a local PostgreSQL database to connect to and extract table relationships.
